## ðŸ¤“About Me

Hello everyone. I'm Cheng Yongkang, I will be a PhD student at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) starting in 2025, and my advisor is Prof. [Mingming Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6BmiCJIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I obtained my master's degree from Northwest A&F University and my bachelor's degree from Nanjing Agricultural University. At present, I work as a researcher at Astribot, a startup focusing on Embodied AI. Prior to this, I served as a research intern at Tencent AILab, under the mentorship of Dr. [Shaoli Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o31BPFsAAAAJ). My research interests include 3D motion generation, motion capture, and Embodied AI.

"Fortunately, my passion lies in the essence of artificial intelligence itself, rather than the mere trappings it brings ! "           --- Yongkang
