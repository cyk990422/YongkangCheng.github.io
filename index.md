## ðŸ¤“About Me

My name is Yongkang Cheng, and I am currently a third-year master's student at Northwest A&F University. At the same time, I serve as an intern at [Tencent AILab](https://ai.tencent.com/) Digital Human Center, supervised by Dr. [Shaoli Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o31BPFsAAAAJ). My research interests lie in 3D action generation, virtual human algorithms, and other computer vision directions. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Nanjing Agricultural University in 2021, where my research focus was on artificial intelligence in agriculture.

"Fortunately, my passion lies in the essence of artificial intelligence itself, rather than the mere trappings it brings ! "           --- Yongkang
